-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The hashistack community generally hangs out [on Discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=1060753787125514332), so
please drop by if you have any questions, comments, concerns, wishes, hopes, dreams, wants, needs, yearnings, musings,
or idle curiosities about hashistack. We love meeting new people and talking with them about how they can best use
hashistack to solve their IaC problems. We know there are gaps in hashistack, and definitely lots of new, powerful
capabilities to add, so hearing about what's working and what could be better will help drive the direction of
hashistack.

If you have other thoughts, or are running into trouble and are not able to get help from the community on Discord,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/QubitPi/hashistack/issues) describing your problem or idea.
