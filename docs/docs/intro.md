The hashicorp-aws community generally hangs out [on Discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=1060753787125514332), so
please drop by if you have any questions, comments, concerns, wishes, hopes, dreams, wants, needs, yearnings, musings,
or idle curiosities about hashicorp-aws. We love meeting new people and talking with them about how they can best use
hashicorp-aws to solve their IaC problems. We know there are gaps in hashicorp-aws, and definitely lots of new, powerful
capabilities to add, so hearing about what's working and what could be better will help drive the direction of
hashicorp-aws.

If you have other thoughts, or are running into trouble and are not able to get help from the community on Discord,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/QubitPi/hashicorp-aws/issues) describing your problem or idea.
