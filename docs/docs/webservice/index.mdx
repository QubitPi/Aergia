Deploying Jersey-Jetty Based Webservice
=======================================

:::tip

- Yes, hashicorp-aws DOES NOT support Spring, **never ever**
- EBS volumes during build time will [automatically be removed][HashiCorp Packer delete_on_termination]

:::

We take an opinionated webservice deployment, which goes without SSL, because
[backend API should site behind a proxy or gateway](https://dev.to/behalf/authentication-authorization-in-microservices-architecture-part-i-2cn0#global-authentication-api-gateway-and-authorization-per-service).
In addition, webservice executables are assumed to be in WAR format and is ready before preceding in this section
(neither Packer nor Terraform environment packages up source code to WAR for the sake of simplicity)

Getting hashicorp-aws Source Code
---------------------------------

```console
git clone https://github.com/QubitPi/hashicorp-aws.git
```

From this point on, we assume the _current directory_ is the directory containing the checked-out `hashicorp-aws` folder

Defining Packer Variables
-------------------------

Create a [HashiCorp Packer variable values file] named "aws-ws.auto.pkrvars.hcl" under
__hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/aws__ directory, depending on the deployment mode, with the following contents:

```hcl title=hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/aws/aws-aws.auto.pkrvars.hcl
ami_region    = "my-aws-region"
ami_name      = "my-webservice"
instance_type = "<one of t2.micro/t2.small/t2.medium/t2.large/t2.xlarge/t2.2xlarge>"
war_source    = "my-webservice-1.0.war"
filebeat_path = "filebeat.yml"
```

- `ami_region` is the [region][AWS regions] where webservice [AMI][AWS AMI] will be published to. The published image
  will be _private_
- `ami_name` is the name of the resulting AMI that will appear when managing AMIs in the AWS console or via APIs. This
  can be the same across builds, because hashicorp-aws will deregister the old AMI with the same name and replace it
  with the current built one
- `instance_type` is the [EC2 instance type][AWS EC2 instance type] to use while building the AMI, such as t2.small.
- `war_source` is the absolute path or the path relative to `hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/basic` of
  the webservice WAR file we are going to deploy
- `filebeat_path` is the absolute path or the path relative to
  `hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/images/aws` of the filebeat config file if the webservice is sending logs
  to ELK

  :::tip

  It is very important to connect webservice to an external logging & auditing service like ELK, because once
  webservice is deployed as an immutable infrastructure, it is completely sealed in a sense that no one can SSH into
  it. This means logs or other metrics are not available unless they are send to an external logging & auditing
  service such as ELK. Our HACP offers out-of-the box deployment of ELK and allow the webservice to automatically
  connect to it to send logs and metrics, which gives us a lot better experience on working with webservice logging
  & auditing.

  :::

### Building AMI Image

```console
cd hashicorp-aws

cp hashicorp/common/images/aws/aws-builder.pkr.hcl hashicorp/webservice/images/aws
cp hashicorp/common/images/aws/aws-packer.pkr.hcl hashicorp/webservice/images/aws

cd hashicorp/webservice/images/aws
packer init .
packer validate .
packer build .
```

:::note

EBS volumes during build time will [automatically be removed][HashiCorp Packer delete_on_termination]

:::

This will take a while and to save time, we can leave it here and proceed immediately to the next step.

### Defining Terraform Variables

Create a [HashiCorp Terraform variable values file] named "aws-ws.auto.tfvars" under one of the subdirectory of
__hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/instances/aws__, depending on the deployment mode, with the following contents:

```hcl title=hashicorp-aws/hashicorp/webservice/instances/aws/aws-ws.auto.tfvars
aws_ec2_region = "my-aws-region"
ami_name          = "my-webservice"
instance_type     = "<one of t2.micro/t2.small/t2.medium/t2.large/t2.xlarge/t2.2xlarge>"
ec2_instance_name = "My Webservice"
security_groups   = ["My Webservice"]
```

- `aws_ec2_region` is the [EC2 runtime region][AWS regions]
- `ami_name` is the name of the published AMI; **it must be the same as the `ami_name` in
  [Packer variable file](#defining-packer-variables)**
- `instance_type` is the [AWS EC2 instance type] used for deployed infrastructure
- `ec2_instance_name` is the deployed EC2 name as appeared in the instance list of AWS console; it can be arbitrary
- `security_groups` is the list of [AWS Security Group] _names_ to associate with (yes, not ID, but name...)

### Deploying to EC2

:::caution

Depending on the [AMI](#defining-packer-variables) and [EC2](#defining-terraform-variables) configs, **please be aware AWS credit charges shall incur after the following
commands execute**

:::

When [AMI image finishes building](#building-ami-image), we can go ahead to deploy that image as an EC2 instance:

```console
cd ../../instances/aws

cp ../../../common/instances/aws/aws-ec2.tf .
cp ../../../common/instances/aws/aws-terraform.tf .

terraform init
terraform validate
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Deployment via Screwdriver CD
-----------------------------

hashicorp-aws supports deployment using [Screwdriver CD](screwdriver-cd-deployment). Please check it out. <img src="https://github.com/QubitPi/QubitPi/blob/master/img/8%E5%A5%BD.gif?raw=true" height="40px"/>

Deployment via GitHub Actions
-----------------------------

hashicorp-aws also supports deployment using [GitHub Actions](github-actions)

Deployment via HACP
-------------------

:::tip

Please try our HACP platform to deploy a Webservice instance. It gives us one-click experience that helps us stand up
a webservice in a minute.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### AWS

#### The Webservice was Running Properly Right After Deployment, but NOT After a While with "503 Service Unavailable"

This could be the resource starvation on EC2 instance. Please try using a bigger EC2 sizes. For example, bumping
_t2.micro_ to _t2.medium_. hashicorp-aws currently supports **t2.x** sizes, i.e. one of the following sizes can be
selected:

- t2.micro
- t2.small
- t2.medium
- t2.large
- t2.xlarge
- t2.2xlarge

To modify the size, set the value of `instance_type` in both _aws-ws.pkrvars.hcl_ and _aws-ws.tfvars_. For
example:

```hcl
instance_type       = "t2.medium"
```
