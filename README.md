-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Aergia community generally hangs out [on Discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=1060753787125514332), so please drop
by if you have any questions, comments, concerns, wishes, hopes, dreams, wants, needs, yearnings, musings, or idle
curiosities about Aergia. We love meeting new people and talking with them about how they can best use Aergia to solve
their IaC problems. We know there are gaps in Aergia, and definitely lots of new, powerful capabilities to add, so
hearing about what's working and what could be better will help drive the direction of Aergia.

If you have other thoughts, or are running into trouble and are not able to get help from the community on Discord,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/QubitPi/aergia/issues) describing your problem or idea.
